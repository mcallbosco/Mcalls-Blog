<p>If you are like me, you are probably a computer science student who is forced to take an assembly class but has no interest in installing Visual Studio and all the crap that comes with just to use it for a few months. Or maybe you just like to use something else than windows. So, I am sharing some Visual Studio Code tasks to make life easier. These are made to use the IRVINE libraries but feel free to modify them however you would like. If any of the files you need to download goes down, I have a backup in the repository containing this document. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mcallbosco/Mcalls-Archive/tree/main/MASM32%20Build%20Task%20VSCODE" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a link to it. </a>You can download the Build Task file using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcallbosco/Mcalls-Archive/main/MASM32%20Build%20Task%20VSCODE/tasks.json" target="_blank">THIS LINK.</a></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be referring to <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/programming/2016/01/30/masm-on-mac-or-linux.html">THIS</a> article by <a href="https://reberhardt.com/blog/">Ryan Eberhardt</a> (If this link doesn’t work there’s a backup in the repo)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WINDOWS</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install MASM32 by downloading the installer from <a href="http://www.masm32.com/">http://www.masm32.com/</a> and then download the Irvine library from “<a href="http://asmirvine.com/">Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 8/e (asmirvine.com)</a>” (Click on the VS 2019 setup and then you will find the download link). Extract the Irvine.zip onto your C: drive and then rename the irvine folder to have a capital I.</p>



<p>                Once you have done that, follow the instructions in the article about setting up your environment variables. When you are finished, the MASM build task is ready to use!</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINUX……… and MAC(Probably?)</p>



<p>                Follow the instructions in the article (including adding the script at the end to your bash_profile). The WGET links are down but you can find the files by going to <a href="http://www.masm32.com/">http://www.masm32.com/</a> and &#8220;<a href="http://asmirvine.com/">Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 8/e (asmirvine.com)</a>” (Click on the VS 2019 setup and then you will find the download link) and do the stuff required manually.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be all set to start building after this by using the MASM Linux build task. It should also work on Macs.</p>

<p>*Thanks to reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/afunkysongaday/">afunkysongaday</a> for helping me figure this out*</p>



<p>If you are here, you’ve probably noticed that the CT10’s Android limits you with what you can do. You can only install certain APKs. That’s boring though. What about if you use Youtube Music or have a Music player you like? Not to mention you may want to customize it some more. Well, this is a guide on how to install 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps.</p>



<p>Prerequisites</p>



<p>You Need</p>



<ul><li>A computer with ADB on it</li><li>The APK files you want to install</li><li>A cable so you can hook up your CT10 to the computer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mcallbosco/Mcalls-Archive/raw/main/Activo%20CT10/term_CT10.apk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THIS APK FILE (CLICK THIS LINK)</a> “term_CT10.apk”</li></ul>



<p>Lets get started.</p>



<ul><li>Plug in the CT10 to your computer and go to it’s internal storage. Navigate to the OpenService folder or make on if it isn’t there. Put “term_CT10.apk” into this folder.</li><li>On the CT10 go to the home screen and press the services button. You should see the Terminal application available to install. Install it.</li><li>Open the terminal application. Enter these 3 commands highlighted in white</li></ul>



<p class="has-white-background-color has-background">setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1</p>



<p class="has-white-background-color has-background">setprop persist.service.debuggable 1</p>



<p class="has-white-background-color has-background">setprop persist.sys.usb.config mtp,adb</p>



<ul><li>Reboot your device and you should be all set. You have to use a computer to install the apps. Do this by using the command</li></ul>



<p class="has-white-background-color has-background">abd install /path/to/apk</p>



<p>…and you should be all set to install whatever you want onto your Activo CT10. Pretty simple right? There are the basic limitations though. Make sure your app is compatible with Android 5. Notifications work but are a bit of a pain to manage with the stock interface. Launchers work just fine (I use Nova 6.2.3). If you open the stock Activo music app it can mess with your background a bit (there may be a setting to disable this, but I have not looked too hard.)</p>



<p>Well, that’s it for my first write-up. I hope this proved useful to some people.</p>
